# Cities: Skylines Urban Road [Work in progress]
A fully modular road asset framework for Cities: Skylines created by automatic module generation and procedural modeling. Based on AmamIya's gorgeously handcrafted CSUE and CSUR sets.

The core road module construction mechanisms in the CSUR framework do not require external Python packages, while Blender 2.80 was used to build all 3D meshes and create texture mappings.
